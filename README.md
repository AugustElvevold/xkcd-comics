# XKCD Comic Viewer

This is my solution to the coding assignment for iOS by Shortcut.
The coding assignment can be found here [coding-assignment-mobile](https://github.com/shortcut/coding-assignment-mobile?tab=readme-ov-file).

### The challange

A client of ours has just discovered xkcd comics.
Disregarding the abundance of similar apps, she wants to create a comic viewer app, right now! She came up with a list of requirements, too! The user should be able to:

* browse through the comics,
* see the comic details, including its description,
* search for comics by the comic number as well as text,
* get the comic explanation
* favorite the comics, which would be available offline too,
* send comics to others,
* get notifications when a new comic is published,
* support multiple form factors.

There are a few services available to ease some of the bullet points. 
There's the [xkcd JSON API](https://xkcd.com/json.html), which can be used to access the comics. 
Then there's [xkcd search](https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com/), which can help with the search. 
Finally, there's [explain xkcd](http://www.explainxkcd.com/), which offers the explanation for all the comics.

### Rules
1. The code should be submitted via GitHub.
2. It should be spendt at most 16 hours working on it.

### The process
1. I started by setting up the project and the basic structure.
